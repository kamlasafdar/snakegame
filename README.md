The project is snake game in assembly language
Introducing the Assembly Snake Game â€“ a classic challenge where you control a snake on a quest to grow by eating food, but beware, touching the boundaries or you ends the game.
Growing Challenge:
Eating food adds segments to the snake, making it longer.
Boundary Dilemma:
The play area is surrounded by boundaries in a square shape. If the snake touches these borders, it's game over.
Clear Game Over Message:
When the game ends, a simple and clear "Game Over" message appears on the screen. At this point, you can restart the game to try your skills again.
