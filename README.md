The project is snake game in assembly language
Introducing the Assembly Snake Game â€“ a classic challenge where you control a snake on a quest to grow by eating food, but beware, touching the boundaries or you ends the game.

Game Basics:
Guide the snake around the screen to consume food, and with each tasty morsel, the snake's length increases. The objective is simple: keep the snake munching and growing without running into the square-shaped boundaries or itself.

Growing Challenge:
Eating food adds segments to the snake, making it longer and the game more interesting. Your goal is to manage the snake's growth while avoiding collisions that would bring the game to an end.

Boundary Dilemma:
The play area is surrounded by boundaries in a square shape. If the snake touches these borders, it's game over. The challenge is to skillfully navigate within the boundaries to prevent an abrupt end to your snake adventure.

Self-Avoidance Strategy:
To up the ante, if the snake collides with its own tail, the game concludes. This adds an extra layer of challenge as you need to maneuver the snake carefully to avoid self-intersection.

Clear Game Over Message:
When the game ends, a simple and clear "Game Over" message appears on the screen. At this point, you can restart the game to try your skills again.

In the world of Assembly Snake, it's all about growing, avoiding boundaries, and steering clear of your own tail. Challenge yourself in this retro-style game where simplicity meets strategy!
